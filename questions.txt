Promises - it seems like he's using promises mostly to cause a delay so the text prints out slowly. why do that?
Also, in his code, he uses do{ await promise.delay(speed)}while(paused).
Why the do while if just the await seems to have the same effect?\


when creating the app, i initially named my js file app.js, the same as in his strml site.
when I did this, it caused the app to run his code from the strml folder, even though all the definitions
were pointing to my app. when I renamed everything and all the references to myapp.js it worked
why would that happen?

variable naming - when i'm passing "the same" variable back and forth, should i use the same name or not?
I.E. - responseObj['gameStep'] to store the gameStep variable, or something else.


Instructions to run -
npm run dev gets the main site up and going
nodemon process_user_input.js gets the responder up and going.
