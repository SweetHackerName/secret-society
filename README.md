#Secret Society
Idea came about as a fun project when some friends and I got the rights to a lapsed url for a haunted hayride that still has a banner advertising it on the highway.

Goal is to eventually have it up on the url. It should initially look like a kind of dinky haunted hayride, but with a glitchy centurion logo in the corner. Clicking on the logo pops up a 'DOS Prompt' that acts as though you are communicating through a terminal with an AI from a silly secret society that is trying to recruit you as a member.

Currently this is mostly being used as a learning project/test bed by Ben (SweetHackerName)
